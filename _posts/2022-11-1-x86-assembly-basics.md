x86 assembly is a low-level programming language that is converted into machine executable code by a utility program such as MASM (Windows) or NASM (Linux). Low-level languages use assemblers to directly translate and are machine-oriented, while high-level languages such as Python use a compiler or interpreter and are more user-friendly.
Low-level languages are faster than high-level but slower than machine languages!

### Benefits of Assembly Language
- Less memory
- Shorter execution time
- 

### PC Hardware
PC hardware has main components of a processor, memory, and registers.
Registers are essential for assembly and are processor components that hold data and addresses.
