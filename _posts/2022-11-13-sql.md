### Relation Characteristics
- all cells in a relation must hold a single value
- no repeating groups (more than one attribute from the same physical & logical domain, such as author1 and author2)
- all values for an attribute/column must be part of the same logical and physical domain
- tuples/rows must be unique and have a primary key 
- the order of tuples and attributes (rows and columns) must be unimportant 
- each attribute within a relation must have a unique name

In the example of `EMPLOYEE(ssn, name, dob)`, `ssn`, `name`, and `dob` are attributes. Tuples would be instances of the EMPLOYEE relation, such as `123-45-6789, Aera, 01/01/2001`.

### Relational Algebra
Relational algebra is a way to query data in a relation. It is similar to sets and set operations. It consists of variables that represent relations and operators that represent the actions taken with the relations. 

There are three basic types of operators:
1. Operations to remove parts of relation
2. Set based operations
3. Operations to join tuples in two relations
